# Identity Verification Example Action Integration

This repo contains an example for an Action that redirects to a service to check a user's identification. The code in this repo is meant to be used as a starting point for an Action integration with a similar purpose and should not be user as-is in production. 

Please see the [Action Integration template](https://github.com/Auth0-Marketplace/TEMPLATE-action-post-login/blob/main/README.md) for information on how to test, modify, and submit your completed integration.
